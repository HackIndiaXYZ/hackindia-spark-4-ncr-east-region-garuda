## Problem Statement

In production, a single container crash triggers a 20-minute incident response: wake up an on-call engineer, SSH in, read logs, identify the root cause, restart the container, verify health, and go back to sleep. This is a fully automatable workflow that most teams still handle manually.

**Auto-Heal turns a 20-minute human incident into a 20-second automated recovery.**

The system continuously monitors a fleet of Docker containers, uses Claude AI to classify the root cause of any failure, automatically redeploys a healthy replacement, and notifies your team via Slack — all before a human even picks up their phone.

### Problem Validation

- On-call burnout is one of the top causes of DevOps engineer turnover — surveys consistently show 2–3am pages as the highest-friction part of the role.
- Container restarts (OOM kills, app crashes, dependency failures) account for the majority of production incidents that resolve themselves after a simple restart — making them ideal candidates for automation.
- Existing tools like Kubernetes self-healing require significant infrastructure investment. Auto-Heal delivers the same outcome with a single `docker-compose up`.

**Target: < 20 seconds end-to-end recovery**

### Data Flow — Failure to Recovery

| Step | Component | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Monitor Engine | Detects failure within 30s via Docker SDK poll |
| 2 | Redis Pub/Sub | Publishes incident event to `incidents` channel |
| 3 | Claude Analyzer | Classifies root cause with confidence score |
| 4 | Auto-Healer | Pulls last-good image, replaces container |
| 5 | Health Verifier | Confirms HTTP health check passes before marking resolved |

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Monitor | Docker SDK + asyncio, 5s poll | Direct API access, async, meets <30s detection requirement without Prometheus overhead |
| AI Brain | Claude Sonnet 4 + regex fast-path | Regex handles 85%+ of obvious failures instantly; Claude handles ambiguous cases — best of both approaches |
| Event Bus | Redis Pub/Sub | Decouples monitor from healer, enables parallel healing of multiple containers |
| Backend | FastAPI | Async routes, built-in Swagger docs, native SSE support via `StreamingResponse` |
| Frontend | React + Recharts + SSE | `EventSource` API gives true real-time updates without WebSocket complexity |
| Persistence | SQLite + SQLAlchemy | Zero config, no Postgres setup overhead in a 36-hour build |
| Alerts | Slack Webhooks | Fast setup, visible on phone during demo, free tier |

**Why not Prometheus + cAdvisor?** That stack requires 8+ hours of configuration. Docker SDK stats every 5 seconds achieves identical detection results in under 1 hour.

**Why a regex fast-path before Claude?** Claude API calls add ~1–2s latency and cost tokens. Six regex patterns cover OOM kills, connection refusals, import errors, segfaults, permission errors, and Python tracebacks — the vast majority of real-world failures. Claude is reserved for genuinely ambiguous cases, keeping the average TTR low and API costs minimal.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker 27+ and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for dashboard)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com)
- A Slack app with Incoming Webhooks enabled (optional but recommended for demo)

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-team/auto-heal.git
cd auto-heal
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
DOCKER_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock
MONITOR_INTERVAL_S=5
MEM_THRESHOLD=0.85
CPU_THRESHOLD=0.90
HEAL_MAX_RETRIES=3
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_S=5
HEALTH_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_S=30
```

### 2. Start the full stack

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts: Auto-Heal backend (port 8000), React dashboard (port 3000), Redis, and all 5 victim containers.

### 3. Open the dashboard

```
http://localhost:3000
```

All 5 containers should appear as green. You're ready to demo.

### 4. Inject a failure (optional manual test)

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/inject/payments-api/oom

# Via script (inject into all containers simultaneously)
bash scripts/inject_all.sh
```

---

## Failure Injection Modes

Each victim container ships with an `inject.py` agent. The dashboard's **Failure Injection** panel calls these via Docker exec — judges can trigger failures themselves.

| Mode | What it does | Expected root-cause tag |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| `oom` | Allocates memory until OOM kill | `OOM` |
| `crash` | Logs a fake traceback and exits | `application_crash` |
| `hang` | Makes the `/health` endpoint stop responding | `application_crash` |
| `dep` | Corrupts the database URL and exits | `dependency_failure` |
| `cpu` | Spins 4 threads at 100% CPU | `application_crash` |

---

## API Reference

See [`docs/API.md`](./docs/API.md) for full endpoint docs. Key endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/stream` | SSE stream — dashboard subscribes here for real-time events |
| `GET` | `/incidents?limit=50` | Recent incident history |
| `GET` | `/containers` | Status of all monitored containers |
| `POST` | `/inject/{container}/{mode}` | Trigger a failure injection |
| `GET` | `/docs` | Auto-generated Swagger UI |

---

## Root-Cause Categories

Claude classifies every incident into one of five categories with a confidence score:

| Category | Description | Example signals |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `OOM` | Memory exhaustion / OOM kill | `OOMKilled`, `out of memory` |
| `application_crash` | Process exit, unhandled exception | `Traceback`, `panic:`, `SIGSEGV` |
| `dependency_failure` | Downstream service unreachable | `ECONNREFUSED`, `dial tcp` |
| `config_error` | Missing module, bad env var, permission denied | `ImportError`, `EACCES` |
| `unknown` | Insufficient signal for classification | — |

## Running Tests

```bash
# Analyzer accuracy (runs 10 labeled failure cases, target >80%)
pytest tests/test_analyzer.py -v

# Monitor detection tests
pytest tests/test_monitor.py -v
```

## Demo

See [`docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](./docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md) for the full 6-minute demo walkthrough.

**Quick version:**
1. Open dashboard — all 5 containers green
2. Inject memory exhaustion into `payments-api`
3. Watch Claude tag it as `OOM — 96% confidence` in real time
4. Container auto-heals, card snaps back to green — TTR: ~18s
5. Check Slack for the alert
6. Inject 3 simultaneous failures — watch parallel healing
